        <p>
          The Bethel Evangelistic Organization (BEO) was founded in 2009 by Rev.
          John Naeem and his wife Ruby. They began working in areas of family
          life, youth, women ministry, leadership training, evangelism and
          missions outreaches and decided to group this work together and name
          it BEO.
        </p>

          The organization progressed well and organized its first Leadership
          Training Camp in 2010. They began missions outreaches to the Marwari
          tribe in Interior Sind in 2011 and now have close to 150 house
          churches in three major districts with over 2000 believers. They
          started missions outreaches to the Marwari tribe in South Punjab in
          2016 and started two sewing and stitching training centers for Marwari
          girls and women. In 2014, they started missions outreach to a closed
          people group.
