              Baptism is a significant rite of passage in many Christian
              traditions, symbolizing the washing away of sin and the
              individual&apos;s admission into the faith community. It can be
              performed through sprinkling, pouring, or immersion, and is often
              considered a sacrament—a visible sign of an inward grace.

              Brick kilns are one of the oldest manufacturing facilities that
              produce bricks, a fundamental building material. They operate
              through firing clay at high temperatures, which historically
              involved manual labor and traditional techniques. Today, they vary
              from small-scale operations to large industrial complexes,
              employing different technologies like Clamp Kilns, Bull’s Trench
              Kilns, Hoffmann Kilns, and Tunnel Kilns.
